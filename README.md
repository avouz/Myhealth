PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Abstract
In the era of technological advancement, Electronic Health Record (EHR) management systems
have become an integral part of modern healthcare. These systems enable the storage, processing,
and management of medical data, which can lead to improved quality, efficiency, and safety
in healthcare delivery. However, many existing EHR systems face various challenges, such
as decentralized structures, lack of cohesion, and inability to exchange information among
them. The aim of this thesis is to address such challenges through the design and implementation
of an integrated, flexible, secure, and reliable EHR management system. The work focuses
on developing an architecture that supports parallel and distributed management of medical
data, leveraging technologies like Kubernetes, Apache Cassandra, Apache Spark, FastAPI,
and ReactJS. The outcome of this work is not merely a prototype application but aims at
developing a broader architecture for an EHR management system.
